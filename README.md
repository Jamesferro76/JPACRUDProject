# JPACRUDProject

# Description
The goal of this project was to create a functioning web interface which could complete CRUD on a database. For this assignment I decided to fix a problem that I encountered when I was a music teach which was having a reliable database of all my instruments. This site gives the user an easy way to keep account of their instruments, with key information such as brand, model, or condition of the instrument.

# Technologies used
Spring, bootStrap, Gradle, Java, CCS, HTML, MySQL, MySQL workbench, git, gitHub

# Lessons learned
Throughout this project I gained a greater understanding of utilizing MySQL workbench and how to create a database. Additionally I solidified my knowledge of creating a full stack project and my understanding of how each part works together to create a cohesive website. I found it especially helpful to follow the chain of events to understand how each page moves to the next. This helped me greatly reduce my time on fixing problems with my code. There were many new Error messages to be found this weekend and I learned to really value the help that they provide.
